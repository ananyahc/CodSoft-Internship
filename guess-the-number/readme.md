# Number Guessing Game

## Overview
This project is a simple Number Guessing Game developed as part of my Codsoft Java Development Internship. The game prompts users to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range and provides feedback on their guesses.

## Features
- Generate a random number between 1 and 100.
- Prompt user to enter their guess.
- Provide feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.
- Limit the number of attempts for guessing.
- Option to play multiple rounds.
- Track and display the user's score based on the number of correct guesses.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Codsoft-Internship.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Codsoft-Internship/NumberGuessingGame
    ```
3. Compile the Java file:
    ```bash
    javac GuessTheNumber.java
    ```
4. Run the program:
    ```bash
    java GuessTheNumber
    ```

## Usage
1. The program will generate a random number between 1 and 100.
2. Enter your guess when prompted.
3. The program will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. Continue guessing until you find the correct number or exhaust your attempts.
5. You can play multiple rounds and your score will be displayed at the end.

## Example
- The game will start by generating a number between 1 and 100.
- You have 5 attempts to guess the correct number.
- After each guess, you'll receive feedback: "Too high" or "Too low."
- If you guess the number correctly, you'll be congratulated and your score will increase.
- If you fail to guess within the allowed attempts, the correct number will be revealed.
- You will then have the option to play again.
